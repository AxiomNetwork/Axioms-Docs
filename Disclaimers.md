# Erc20 Token Distributions

The airdrop distribution method for erc20 tokens is via the Axioms smart contract. The airdrop creator inputs both the erc20 tokens for distribution and an appropriate amount of Ethereum to cover the gas fees involved in the airdrop. These tokens are held securely in the smart contract in which the Axioms team has no direct control over the funds regarding distribution. 
Once the tokens are in the smart contract, and the airdrop campaign ends, the smart contract will send all claimed tokens to the respective Axioms user. Remaining unclaimed tokens, if any, are returned to the sending Ethereum address.




# Non-collaterized Airdrop Distributions (Independent Chains)

The airdrop distribution method for non-collaterized independent chain coins and tokens is via the airdrop creator themselves after the completion of the airdrop campaign. Since these coins and tokens are unable to be held in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, Axioms and the Axioms team do not have a means to hold the coins or tokens on deposit/collateral for the duration of the airdrop. The Axioms platform does provide a means to connect the airdropper and end-user (airdrop hunter), as well as provide the distribution amounts to the airdropper based on the success of the campaign.
Upon completion of the airdrop campaign, Axioms provides the appropriate database information to the airdropper (wallet information of users and how many coins or tokens are to be distributed to the wallets). Axioms may also provide a coded script to assist in the distribution process of the coins or tokens to automate the process for the airdropper. 
Since the coins or tokens, in the non-collaterized airdrop method are held by the airdropper, Axioms and the Axioms team, is not responsible for the distribution, amounts distributed, or timing of the distribution. The airdropper assumes this responsibility, solely and in full. Airdrop participants assume this risk by participating in the airdrop.
